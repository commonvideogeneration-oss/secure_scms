### Reflection on Design Decisions

The most important aspects of the design in this project were to strike a balance between costs and security, and scalability demands in a real business environment. The choice of cloud-based infrastructure instead of an on-premises solution demonstrated the necessity to consider long-term operational expenses, flexibility and resilience instead of paying attention to the initial capital outlay. The comparison of cloud providers was one of the areas where trade-offs were the most apparent since reduced expenses had to be balanced with the disparities in ecosystems of services, stability in performance, and integration functionalities (Kezron, 2024). The analysis supported the fact that business-critical systems need cost-effective solutions, which will not compromise high availability and security expectations.

The project also highlighted the importance of security-by-design in minimising organisational risk with special reference to network segmentation, access control, and layers of defence. Notably, exercise enhanced professional sensitivity to the intersection of technical, financial, and ethical in the real-life system design.
