# **Network Design**

## **1. System Overview and Requirements**

The booking system of Truelec is a centrally hosted application and serves the purpose of scheduling jobs, assigning the electricians and the engineers, handling the details of clients and monitoring the status of projects in the headquarters and the branch offices. The administrative staff, project managers, and site supervisors operate the system using web browsers and connect to customer information, job histories, and billing references stored in internal databases (Di Martino, Graziano and Gracco, 2022). The system is a business-critical application, and it needs to be run 24 hours a day and be able to serve multiple users in different locations.
The major functional requirements are the ability to perform reliable user authentication, real-time updating of bookings, secure access to the shared records and integration with the existing organisational services. Non-functional requirements are also significant. The system deals with sensitive customer and operational information, and there should be a great deal of confidentiality and integrity restrictions. This should be highly available as the downtime of the system would directly impact the field and client commitments. The performance requirements are low response times and regular accessibility during the peak business hours and across wide-area connections.
Scalability is one of the fundamental requirements since the business is growing and other branch offices may be onboard. It must be structured in such a way that resources can be increased, and services are not affected. Network segmentation, data encryption during transmission and rest, and continuous monitoring are security requirements (Aryan and Shetty, 2024). 

## **2. Network Architecture and Design **
## Assumptions
The proposed network architecture of Truelec is such that it provides secure, reliable and scalable access to the booking system and integrates into the current enterprise network, as discussed in Section 4.1. The logical design is based on a multi-layered design, dividing external access, application services and data storage to reduce the risk and enhance manageability. This design is depicted in the network diagram of Draw.io, where the connectivity to on-premises is depicted, as well as the connection to cloud-based resources.
Cloud environment is at a high level arranged in a specific virtual network (VPC in AWS or VNet in Azure), which is divided into several subnets depending on the purpose. Components which need controlled access to the internet, like load balancers or bastion hosts, are in public subnets, whereas application servers and databases are in private subnets. This segregation will make sure that there will be no direct access to critical services on the internet, and the attack surface will be low.
The design has a significant security principle of network segmentation. The application servers are not connected to the database resources, and the presence of strict traffic rules between tiers is possible. Firewalls and security groups are set to allow only essential ports and protocols, such as HTTPS traffic between users and application servers, and limited access to databases by trusted application elements (Martseniuk et al., 2024). Firewall policies and access control lists are enforced at the network perimeter and apply both inbound and outbound traffic policies as per the organisational security requirements (Andersen, 2004).
Multiple levels of redundancy are used to deal with high availability. The cloud resources may not be installed on a single availability zone, but they may be spread across several availability zones such that, in case of the failure of one availability zone, the other availability zones will not fail. This supplements the robust, wide-area network and firewall design architecture that is connected to the on-premises.
